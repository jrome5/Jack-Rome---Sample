Problem description
A robot must load and unload packages into and out of a delivery truck. Packages unloaded from the
delivery truck must be brought to the appropriate warehouse. Small packages must go to Warehouse A and
large packages must go to Warehouse B. Medium packages, which are initially stored in either Warehouse A
or Warehouse B, must be loaded onto the delivery truck. The truck initially contains S small packages and L
large packages. Warehouse A initially contains Ma medium packages and Warehouse B initially contains Mb
medium packages. Assume that both warehouses are adjacent to the truck and that the robot can freely
move between the truck and the warehouses. The robot can only move one package at a time, regardless of
size, from one location to another.
