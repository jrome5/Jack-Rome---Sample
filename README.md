# Jack-Rome---Sample
A sample of my robotics work at university
Contents:
Java
Use of A* to solve the packages problem. Details of problem can be found in the Java folder. Code and report can also be found.
  
Python
Work with ROS to program a turtlebot. Potential fields algorithm is utilized to autonomously navigate to a given point without collision with obstacles. A map of the area is generated using gmapping and Monte Carlo localization then uses the map to navigate through the area more efficiently than the potential fields algorithm. Git contains code for potential fields, reporting on project, generated maps and Rviz files.

C/C++
Home-made robot buggy is programmed with Arduino to use an ultrasonic sensor to autonomously roam without collision. A simple reactive agent. Code and report can be found.
